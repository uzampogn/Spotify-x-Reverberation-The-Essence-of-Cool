# Spotify-x-Reverberation-The-Essence-of-Cool

Author: Ulysse Zampogna

The project consists in revealing the secrets of the best radio on earth (according to me): Reverberation. This radio is a collective of artists based in Austin texas, regularly featuring guests apperarences from all over the world. The radio releases one show on a weekly basis. The music selection is excquisit and covers an eclectic range of music. 

But, what makes it so special? Let's compare it with a few popular playlists on Spotify and try to define the Reverberation's Essence of Cool. 

This Data Science project is broken down in 3 notebooks:
 - [Part 1](https://github.com/uzampogn/Spotify-x-Reverberation-The-essence-of-cool/blob/main/Spotify%20x%20RVB%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Data%20Collection.ipynb) uses [Spotipy API](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) to collect data from a dozen of Spotify playlists. 
 - [Part 2](https://github.com/uzampogn/Spotify-x-Reverberation-The-essence-of-cool/blob/main/Spotify%20x%20RVB%20-%20Part%202%20-%20EDA.ipynb) performs an exploratory data analysis to unveal the secrets of each playlist and compare them to Reverberation. 
 - [Part 3](https://github.com/uzampogn/Spotify-x-Reverberation-The-essence-of-cool/blob/main/Spotify%20x%20RVB%20-%20Part%203%20-%20Multi-class%20classification.ipynb) focuses on a multi-class classification problem. It compares a series of classifiers - ([Na√Øve Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) & [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) - which takes as input a given track and predicts the best matching playlist.

# EDA Executive summary:

Reverberation Radio is special because of its:

   1. Eclectism. Reverberation features 10x more diversity (music genres) than its benchmarcks and is specialized in niche genres.
   2. Richness. Reverberation contains 10 to 30x more tracks as a playlist. Collectively, the playlist spans 70+ years of music history.
   3. Niche. Collectable. Rarities. Reverberation has by far the lowest average track popularity. On average, -73% less popular than other playlists.
   2. Happiness Concentrate. Finally, Reverberation shows a significantly higher valence (measure of happiness) than other playlists (+19% on average)
   
Currently Reverberation operates mainly from its [tumblr](https://reverberationradio.com/) which also features their personal website for merch (powered by Shopify), Apple Podcast, Instagram and Twitter accounts. Overall, their internet footprint is quite disparate which certainly undermines their capacity of reaching a greater audience as well as converting these fans into financial support for the collective and its artists.

### Business case:

Developing Reverberation Radio visibility and activity on Spotify would help consolidating their fanbase and monetize it seamingly. A few advantages Spotify proposes:

   1. 400+Mio monthly listeners with an extremely performant Machine Learning infrastructure enabling personalized discovery for every user - no matter their taste. Utilizing Spotify's services, Reveberation radio could unleash the power of its unique selection to a greater audience of interest.
   
   
   2. By taking control of its fanbase, the radio could understand in details who composes their audience and most dedicated fans. This first step consistutes the basis for developing further the reverberation brand and activities. 
   
   
   3. Reverberation could promote its merchandise and connect directly its existing Shopify account on Spotify. Effectively centralizing its fanbase analytics and merchandise activities. Hence, enabling a seamless shopping experience directly from the streaming platform users utilize daily.
   
   
   4. Reverberation could turn their collectable/rarities trademark by proposing through Spotify services limited/collector items - including merch, records or web3 tokens. Especially because the radio often collaborates with successful designers and visual artists (for example [Jaime Zu](https://jaimezu.bigcartel.com/)). His art is featured all over Reverberation's tumblr or merch selection. In short, exciting artistic and business opportunities emerge when considering the whole eco-system of Reverberation collective.
   

Finally, Reveberation is one example of many small communities of independent artists that can greatly benefit from the breadth of services proposed by Spotify while continuing to focus on what matters the most - its art. Many similar communities exist all over the world and are not yet included in Spotify's catalog. The best example of artistic and business success is the infamous *King Gizzard and The Lizzard Wizard* band with its Flightless Records. A true masterclass of turning an independent band/label into a success story.
