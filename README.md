Author: Ulysse Zampogna

The project consists in revealing the secrets of the best radio on earth (according to me): Reverberation. This radio is a collective of artists based in Austin texas, regularly featuring guests apperarences from all over the world. The radio releases one show on a weekly basis. The music selection is excquisit and covers an eclectic range of music history. 

But what make this radio so special? Let's compare it with a few popular playlists on Spotify and try to define the Reverberation's essence of Cool. 

This Data Science project is broken down in 3 notebooks:
 - [Part 1](https://github.com/uzampogn/Spotify-x-Reverberation-The-essence-of-cool) uses [Spotipy API](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) to collect data from a dozen of playlists. 
 - [Part 2](https://github.com/uzampogn/Spotify-x-Reverberation-The-essence-of-cool) performs an exploratory data analysis to unveal the secrets of each playlist. 
 - [Part 3](https://github.com/uzampogn/Spotify-x-Reverberation-The-essence-of-cool) is a series of classifiers ([Na√Øve Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) & [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) which takes any track and predicts the best matching playlist. Let's see if a given track could enter the exquisit Reverberation playlist.
